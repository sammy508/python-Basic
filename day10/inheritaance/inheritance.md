# Python Inheritance


Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
# 
# example
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()

# Use the super() Function
Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:

# Example
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)


# Add Properties
# Example
Add a property called graduationyear to the Student class:

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = 2019
